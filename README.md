# 3. Determine the list of numbers that represents the result of these range expressions.
# 4. Determine the output generated by each of the following code fragments.
# 5. Write a program that calculates the volume and surface area of a sphere for a given radius. The volume of the sphere is calculated as V = 4 / 3 * Pi * r ** 3, and the surface area as A = 4 * Pi * r ** 2.
# 6. Write a program that calculates the price per square centimeter of a pizza for a given radius and the total price of the entire pizza. A = r ** 2 * Pi.
# 7. Write a program that calculates the molecular mass of a hydrocarbon molecule based on the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms it contains. The atomic masses are as follows: H (hydrogen) = 1.0079, C (carbon) = 12.011.
# 8. Write a program that determines the distance of an observer from lightning based on the time difference between the moment the lightning appears and the moment the sound reaches the observer. The speed of sound is 340 m/s.
# 9. A coffee shop sells coffee for 105 dinars per kilogram. For home delivery, there is an additional charge of 18 dinars per kilogram and a fixed fee of 15 dinars. Write a program that calculates the total cost of a home order.
# 10. Two points in a plane are given by coordinates (x1; y1) and (x2; y2). Write a program that calculates the slope of the line passing through the given points. m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
# 11. Calculate the distance between two points in a plane (see the previous task). d = sqrt((x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2)
# 12. Epact represents the age of the moon in days on January 1st. It is used for calculating the date of Easter. The Gregorian epact is calculated using the following formulas (integer arithmetic): C = year / 100, epact = (8 + C / 4 - C + ((8C + 13) / 25) + 11(year%19))%30. Write a program that asks the user for a year as a 4-digit number and calculates the Gregorian epact.
# 13. Write a program that calculates the area of a triangle for given side lengths a, b, and c. s = (a+b+c) / 2, A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)).
# 14. Write a program that calculates the length of a ladder for a given height to be reached and the angle at which the ladder is inclined. d = height / sin(angle).
# 15. Write a program that calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers, where n is entered by the user.
# 16. Write a program that calculates the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers, where n is entered by the user.
# 17. Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers entered by the user. First, the user should enter the number of numbers to be added. Then, enter all the numbers and finally, print the sum.
# 18. Write a program that calculates the average of numbers entered by the user (similar to the previous task). The average should be a float.
# 19. Write a program that calculates an approximation of the number Pi as a partial sum of this series: 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11 + ... The program should ask for the number of terms in this series to be summed.
# 20. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number represents the sum of the previous two. This sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... Write a program that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number, where n is entered by the user. Fibonacci numbers grow very quickly, and the program must handle very large numbers.
# 21. The math package contains a function for calculating the square root. It is necessary to write your own function to calculate the square root using the "try-and-improve" approach. First, we try to guess the value of the square root and compare it with the actual value (returned by sqrt). Then we make the next guess and get closer to the solution. We repeat the process until we find the correct value of the square root or its sufficiently good approximation. For this task, you can use the Newton-Raphson method. Let x be the number whose square root we are seeking, and guess be the value we are trying to guess the square root. The guess can be improved using the value (guess + x / guess) / 2 in the next iteration. Write a program that implements the Newton-Raphson method. The program asks the user for the number whose square root is sought (x) and the number of attempts. The initial guess is set to x = 2. At the end of the program, print the value obtained by the Newton-Raphson method and the value returned by sqrt.
